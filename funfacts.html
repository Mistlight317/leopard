	    <li>The leopard was originally thought to be a hybrid of the lion and the jaguar. 
		There has been much genetic confusion around the leopard and it wasn't properly distinguished until about 100 years ago.
		</li><li>Female leopards have a unique scent and rub their bodies against trees to leave their smell there as an indication that they are ready to mate.
		</li><li>The origin of the leopard's name stems from another misconception that they were hybrids, although in this instance it was thought that leopards were hybrids of lions and panthers. As a result, the word "leopard" comes from the combination of two Greek words, "leon" and "pardos", which mean "lion" and "male panther" respectively.
		</li><li>Some people believe that leopard whiskers and bones can heal the sick. Partially because of this, many leopards are killed each year for their fur and body parts, earning them a spot on the list of endangered animals.
