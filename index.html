      <h1>The Leopard: <em>Panthera pardus</em></h1>

	    <p>The leopard, or <em>Panthera pardus</em>, is a member of the "Big Cat" family. 
	    Leopards are medium-sized wildcats and agile and opportunistic hunters. Of the leopard species, there are many different sub-species, the African leopard, Amur leopard, and Arabian leopard being just three of them.
      </p>
	    <p>As for the appearance of leopards, they have a larger, stockier build than that of a cheetah, with the females weighing 46 to 132 pounds and the males weighing 80 to 165 pounds (measurements vary geographically). They also sport a long tail that helps to balance them while in the trees. Their limbs and head have black spots on them, and the tips of their tails are white on the underside. The main part of their bodies are dotted with rosettes, ring-like patterns that resemble roses. These markings help them camoflauge into their environment.
      </p>
	    <p>Leopards are muscular and strong, allowing them to easily leap up into trees. Also, like most big cats, leopards have retractable claws, or claws that can be drawn into folds of skin on their paws. Their large, grayish/greenish eyes provide them with binocular vision to accurately determine distances, and their large pupils let them see during dark nights (leopards' night vision is six to eight times better than that of humans). Leopards also have a strong sense of smell and hearing, and sport long whiskers that help them to detect small prey in dark spaces; they also inform leopards about the size of the space they are about to enter, ensuring that they don't get stuck.
