	  <h2>The Prey of Leopards</h2>
	    <p>Leopards mainly hunt medium-sized mammals, like warthogs, deer, and medium and small antelope. However, they also eat smaller prey, like birds, rodents, and reptiles, and will even eat dung beetles when other prey is scarce. By eating smaller prey than other predators, leopards can avoid competition with them. If they live near human settlements, they will also often prey on dogs, and, rarely, even attack people.

	  <h2>The Predators of Leopards</h2>
	    <p>Even if leopards are able to mostly avoid other predators, they will still occasionally come across one that is a particular danger to them. One of the biggest threats to adult leopards is other leopards that may be in the area. Lions and tigers may also kill a leopard if they get close enough, although this is rarer, as the other big cats are not as proficient at climbing as leopards. Leopard cubs are far more vulnerable than adult leopards, with predators such as hyenas, jackals, snakes, and birds of prey. These animals often try to attack cubs when their mother is out hunting and not able to protect them. Leopards are also hunted by humans for their meat and fur, and for trophies.
