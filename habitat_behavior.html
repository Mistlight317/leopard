	  <h2>The Habitats of Leopards</h2>
	  
	  <p>Out of all the big cats, leopards have the largest distribution, meaning they live in the largest variety of habitats. Leopards can be found in a multitude of places in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, savannahs, woodlands, and mountains being just a few of them. Although they are commonly spotted in these areas, there are also small groups of leopards in remote locations in Northern Africa, the Far East, and Arabia. Leopards have adapted to the growing presence of humans and both live and hunt close to urban areas, allowing them to successfully survive in an increasingly human-dominated planet.</p>
	  
	  <h2>The Lifestyle of Leopards</h2>
	  
	  <p>Leopards mostly sleep during the day and hunt at night, although there are some places where this is the opposite. They are ambush predators, meaning they stalk their prey until they are close enough, then pounce. This conserves their energy because they don't have to chase their prey and wear it down before killing it. After successfully catching their prey, they drag it into dense vegetation or up into a tree, away from other predators that may try to steal it. There, they either eat the prey immediately, or leave it in the tree to store it for later, when they are hungry. Leopards are also solitary creatures and rarely interact with other leopards apart from mating and raising cubs. They mark their territory with scent markings and rasping calls that sound like the sawing of wood.</p>
      
      <p>Leopards give birth to cubs any time of the year, since they are non-seasonal breeders. After a gestation period lasting about three months, they give birth to between two and three cubs. These newborn cubs are grayish with barely visible spots. They are blind and weigh barely one pound, making them very vulnerable in the wild. Because of this, their mother will keep them hidden in dense vegetation until they are between six and eight weeks old, able to follow their mother around. The cubs are weaned at three months old and then remain with their mother for another 18 months until she is ready to mate again.</p>
	  
	  <p> At the age of about two years, mother leopards begin encouraging their cubs to establish their own territories, also called home ranges. While male leopards are almost completely solitary apart from mating, female leopards tend to stay near their mother, often establishing territories close to or overlapping hers. Home range sizes vary depending on the habitat and available food, but the territories of male leopards are generally larger than those of females. Male leopard territories also often overlap the territories of females and other males. The average lifespan of a leopard is 10-15 years, depending on habitat and food supply.
